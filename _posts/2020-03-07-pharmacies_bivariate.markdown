excerpt: An attempt at using a bivariate choropleth to display the same dataset as the map below.

This is the exact same data and analysis as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pharmacies/">the previous one</a>, but this time I tried to use a bivariate choropleth to show all the information in just one picture (e.g. for print).
I think it looks pretty, but a bit confusing.
