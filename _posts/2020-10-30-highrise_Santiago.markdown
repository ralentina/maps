excerpt: A simple animated map about speculative real estate development in the centre of Santiago de Chile.

This is my first experiment with a time-map, using [data](https://geoine-ine-chile.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f034dd83d9de4526939fed750aa58e5f) on building permits issued between 2010 and 2019 in the Metropolitan Area. It includes buildings with six or more floors, and the size of the dot reflects the building height.

The pace of construction is staggering, especially along Irarrázaval (the road crossing Ñuñoa) and Avenida Independencia, likely because of the recent expansion of MetroSantiago.
The area that stands out the most, however, is Estación Central, notorious for its ['vertical ghettos'](https://www.eldinamo.cl/blog/aqui-se-dice-porque-se-construyen-los-guetos-verticales-en-estacion-central/).
