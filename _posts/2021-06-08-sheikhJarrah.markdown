An improvised map in support of Grassroots Al-Quds' <a href='https://twitter.com/grassroots_quds/status/1399753138341658624' target='_blank'>online campaign</a> about forced displacement in Al-Sheikh Jarrah. It isn't perfect but it was made in one night, based on information from <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-sheikh-jarrah-jerusalem-neighbourhood-eviction-explained" target="_blank">Middle East Eye</a>, <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-204525/" target="_blank">UN OCHA</a> and <a href='https://peacenow.org.il/en/%D9%8Dsheikh-jarrah-appeal-rejected-160221' target="_blank">Peace Now</a>.
