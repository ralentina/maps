In Chile, as in many other countries, the Covid-19 pandemic has underscored stark geographical and social inequalities in Internet access.
Such digital inequalities matter because they are likely to exacerbate other forms of inequality, because remote working and education are an option only for some (already privileged) population groups.

These graphics were published through the [CIGIDEN](cigiden.cl/) social media networks to highlight these issues.

In the Santiago Metropolita Región the difference between the Eastern, wealthier neighbourhoods and the rest of the city are stark, and probably unsurprisin for those who are familiar with the city.

There are also important differences at the regional level, and even when one considers mobile internet connections (arguably, not sufficient for remote working and schooling).
Of course, the scale of inequalities become even more apparent when comparing income groups and age difference, showing that working or studying for home is not an option available to everyone.
