excerpt: A map that summarises key urban planning and infrastructural intervetions to consolidate Israeli control over Jerusalem.

---

The map tries to highlight how land planning, urban and infrastructural development work together to reiforce the colonisation of Jerusalem. So, for example, Jerusalem grows, stretching into the West Bank, in ways that fragment Palestinian communities on both sides of the green line (see also <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/greaterJerusalem/">the map on the Greater Jerusalem plan</a>). These new neighbourhoods are then conected through high-speed roads and railways, turning them into attractive areas to live in for a lot of people. Meanwhile, national parks are used to limit the expansion of Palestinian neighbourhoods, and often to displace current residents.
