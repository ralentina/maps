excerpt: A very quick, semi-serious map showing Chilean communities abroad voted in the 2020 constitutional referendum.

On the 25th October 2020, Chile held a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/26/chile-vote-scrap-pinochet-constitution">referendum</a> to change its constitution, which was imposed during Pinochet's military dictatorship. People voted overwhelmingly for change: the 'apruebo' (yes to changes) obtained a 78.28 %, the rechazo (no to changes) just 21.72%.  

The map shows (partial) results of the vote abroad. In many countries, for example France, the majority of Chileans are individuals who were forced to leave during the dictatorship, and their relatives, so it was hardly surprising the see the 'apruebo' triumph.
Given the <a href="https://interferencia.cl/articulos/vitacura-y-versalles-la-derrota-de-la-elite">strong correlation between people income and voting choices</a>, it also makes sense that places such as the Emirates would reject the changes. Another exception was Venezuela, which often used as a threat to dissuade Chileans from backing any sort of left-leaning policy change.

Impressively, in Morocco (4 votes) and Vietnam (11 votes), the apruebo obtained a square 100%.
